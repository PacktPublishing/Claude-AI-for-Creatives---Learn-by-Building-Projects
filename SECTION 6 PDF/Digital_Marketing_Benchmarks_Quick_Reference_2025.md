## FINAL NOTES

**Remember:**
- Benchmarks are *guides*, not laws. Your specific results depend on product quality, pricing, competition, and seasonality.
- Always compare against YOUR OWN past performance first. Beating your last campaign is more important than hitting industry averages.
- Test everything. What works for others might not work for you.
- Track metrics DAILY for the first 7 days of a new campaign, then weekly.

**Most Common Mistakes:**
1. ❌ Judging campaigns too early (wait at least 3-7 days for data)
2. ❌ Comparing apples to oranges (B2C vs B2B metrics are different)
3. ❌ Ignoring mobile vs desktop performance splits
4. ❌ Not tracking conversion quality (cheap leads ≠ good leads)
5. ❌ Forgetting to account for seasonality (Q4 costs 30-50% more)
